Data Models

### Event Types

*   Terra automatically sends data to you, each with their own [event types](/docs/event-types)
     . You will need to parse and consider each one separately.

### Data Models

*   In most cases, you will be dealing with events that are data related. These will always contain data in the same structure as depicted [here](/docs/data-models)
