Adding application logo

## Default providers

One of the parameters for the connection widget is a list of providers you'd like to allow your user to select from and connect a wearable. To avoid updating your code (and hence having to push production code) only to change providers, you have the option to set a list of default providers for your widget sessions instead of padding the parameter in the request. This can be found under API > Connections
